# Jenkins Pipeline for Continuous Deployment

This directory contains a sample `Jenkinsfile` that implements a basic **Continuous Deployment (CD)** pipeline. The pipeline automates the process of building, testing, and deploying code to staging and production environments.

## Pipeline Stages

1. **Checkout**: Fetches the code from the specified Git repository and branch.
2. **Build**: Compiles or packages the code using a build script (`build.sh`).
3. **Test**: Runs unit and integration tests using a test script (`run-tests.sh`). If tests fail, the pipeline stops.
4. **Deploy to Staging**: Deploys the code to a staging environment using a deploy script (`deploy.sh`).
5. **Approve for Production**: Waits for manual approval before deploying to production.
6. **Deploy to Production**: Deploys the code to the production environment after approval.

## How to Use

1. **Set Up Jenkins**:
   - Install Jenkins on your server or use a cloud-based Jenkins instance.
   - Install the necessary plugins (e.g., Git, Pipeline).

2. **Configure the Pipeline**:
   - Create a new pipeline job in Jenkins.
   - Point the job to this `Jenkinsfile` in your repository.

3. **Add Scripts**:
   - Create `build.sh`, `run-tests.sh`, and `deploy.sh` scripts in your repository to handle the build, test, and deployment steps.

4. **Run the Pipeline**:
   - Trigger the pipeline manually or configure it to run automatically on code changes.

## Example Scripts

### `build.sh`
```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Building the application..."
# Simulate a build process
sleep 2
echo "Build complete!"
